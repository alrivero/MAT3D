# MAT3D
MAT3D is an web application designed to serve as a robust matrix calculator. MAT3D was designed as a software design project for CMPS115 at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

With MAT3D, a user can define matrices and carry out complex matrix calculations on matrices of any size. Additionally, MAT3D exhibits special functionality for 3x3 and 4x4 matrices: graphical visualization. Using a preloaded model or external OBJ file, MAT3D users can apply computed matrices to 3D objects to visualize linear transformation.
